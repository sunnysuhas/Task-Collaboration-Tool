|                     React Client (Vercel)                   |
|  - Pages (Dashboard, Kanban, Workspaces, Profile)           |
|  - Store (Zustand) & Queries (React Query)                  |
|  - Real-time Connection (Socket.io Client)                  |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
                               |
                   HTTP / WS   |   REST Requests / Event streams
                               v
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                     Node / Express API Server (Render)      |

## 11. API Design

All endpoints reside under `/api` and enforce JSON structures:

| Endpoint | Method | Middleware | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/auth/register` | POST | RateLimit | User signup + creates default workspace |
| `/auth/login` | POST | RateLimit | User login, signs and cookies JWT token |
| `/auth/me` | GET | RequireAuth | Returns details of authenticated user |
| `/workspaces` | GET | RequireAuth | Lists all workspaces user is member of |
| `/workspaces` | POST | RequireAuth | Creates a workspace with caller as Owner |
| `/workspaces/:id/invitations` | POST | RequireAdmin | Generates a signed signup/invite URL |
| `/:workspaceId/projects` | GET | RequireAuth | Lists projects inside a workspace |
| `/:workspaceId/projects` | POST | RequireAdmin | Creates a new project in the workspace |
| `/:workspaceId/projects/:pId/tasks` | POST | RequireAdmin | Adds a task inside a specific project |
| `/:workspaceId/projects/:pId/tasks/:tId`| PATCH | RequireEditTask| Updates task fields or changes status |
| `/:workspaceId/tasks/:tId/comments` | POST | RequireAuth | Adds a comment to a task card |
| `/notifications` | GET | RequireAuth | Fetches notifications list for user |
| `/analytics/dashboard` | GET | RequireAuth | Generates numbers for completions, charts |

---

## 12. Authentication Flow

```
+-----------+            1. POST Credentials            +------------+
|           | ----------------------------------------> |            |
|   React   |                                           |  Express   |
|   Client  | <---------------------------------------- |    Server  |
|           |         2. Set-Cookie JWT Cookie          |            |
+-----------+                                           +------------+
      |                                                        |
      | 3. Subsequent Request with JWT Cookie                  |
      +-------------------------------------------------------->
```
* **Password Hashing:** Passwords are dynamically hashed using `bcryptjs` with 12 salt rounds before database persistence.
* **JWT Delivery:** Upon credentials matching, server signs a JWT containing user ID and writes it in an HTTP-only, secure, same-site `Lax` cookie named `taskflow_token`.
* **Password Recovery:** If a user loses their password, they supply their email, retrieve their pre-selected Security Question, and answer it. The server verifies the Bcrypt-hashed answer and returns a 30-minute transient `resetToken` authorizing them to set a new password.

## 13. Google OAuth Flow

TaskFlow delegates single-sign-on (SSO) to Google using Passport:
1. Client initiates OAuth by clicking the Google button, opening `/api/auth/google`.
2. Backend redirects to Google Consent screen using Google client credentials.
3. User logs in, Google callbacks to `/api/auth/google/callback` with profile details.
4. Passport resolves the email, matches/creates the user in MongoDB, establishes their default workspace, and generates a session JWT.
5. Server redirects the browser window back to the client dashboard (`/dashboard`), passing the cookie securely.

---

## 14. RBAC Design

TaskFlow enforces strict role checks on API and UI layers:

| Action | Owner | Admin | Member |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Delete Workspace | **Yes** | No | No |
| Promote/Demote Members | **Yes** | No | No |
| Edit Workspace Settings | **Yes** | No | No |
| Create Projects | **Yes** | **Yes** | No |
| Edit Projects | **Yes** | **Yes** | No |
| Invite New Teammates | **Yes** | **Yes** | No |
| Create & Assign Tasks | **Yes** | **Yes** | No |
| View Boards and Feeds | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| Update Assigned Task Status | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| Add Comments to Tasks | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |

---

## 15. Features

1. **Agile workspaces:** High-level buckets isolating teams and directories.
2. **Interactive Kanban Board:** Beautifully styled columns with task priority and assignee avatars.
3. **Real-time Synchronization:** Socket.io listeners update the board instantaneously for all users inside the project room.
4. **Data Visualizations:** Interactive Stat Cards and Recharts tracking workload distribution.
5. **Robust Notifications:** Notifications trigger when assigned a task, mentioned in comment, or upon invitation acceptance.
6. **Dark Mode Integration:** Coherent theme switching using Tailwind class hooks.

## 17. Deployment Architecture

* **Frontend:** Hosted on **Vercel** as a Static Web App. Rewrites are configured in `vercel.json` to route single-page router endpoints back to `index.html`.
* **Backend:** Deployed as a web service on **Render**, running Node.js. Environment variables (like JWT secrets, Google OAuth tokens, and database URIs) are wired directly in Render dashboard configs.
* **Database:** Hosted on **MongoDB Atlas** in a multi-region Shared Tier cluster.

---

## 18. Testing Strategy

The QA strategy is built on double-validation:
1. **Manual Smoke Testing:** Verifying password recoveries, OAuth popups, and dark mode triggers.
2. **Automated E2E Testing:** Handled by Playwright browser test runners, mocking database environments and checking route blockings.

---

## 19. Playwright E2E Testing

Playwright tests run in isolated context files inside `/tests/e2e`:
* `taskflow.fixture.js`: Spawns a REST API helper client and configures authentication cookies.
* `taskflow.spec.js`: Evaluates registration, login, workspaces switches, Kanban task updates, and API-enforced RBAC blocks.
* `screenshots.spec.js`: Custom automation script logging into the demo database, creating workspaces, boards, and saving 29 images into correct repository folders.

---

## 20. Security Measures

* **Token Isolation:** Access tokens are stored exclusively in HTTP-Only, Lax SameSite cookies, shielding the app from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
* **Rate Limiting:** Express Rate Limit caps IP requests at 600 per 15 minutes to block DDoS or brute-force attempts.
* **Helmet.js Integration:** Injects secure HTTP headers preventing iframe clickjacking and cross-site scripting.
* **Origin Checkers:** Custom middleware validates `Origin` headers against allowed client lists.

---

## 21. Challenges Faced

1. **State Hydration:** Synchronizing local Zustand states, React Query caches, and incoming real-time Socket.io messages. Solved by standardizing React Query invalidation upon socket events.
2. **OAuth Local Testing:** Testing Google OAuth locally requires callback routes mapped to `http://localhost:5000`. Resolved by configuring conditional callback URLs depending on environment flags.

---

## 22. Future Enhancements

* **Workspace Multi-tenancy Billing:** Stripe integration for workspace seat upgrades.
* **Gantt Charts View:** Timeline visualization showing project task sequences.
* **Slack & MS Teams Webhooks:** Dispatch notifications to outer messaging channels on key workspace updates.

---
